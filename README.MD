# random-positive-messages

Hello everyone! This is the first package that I made, following a tutorial from a Platzi's course. I thought that this package would be useful if someone needs motivation while working or if someone needs some positive/motivational quotes for a project. I hope that whoever is using this can contribute to this little project by adding their own quotes or someone's else quotes to grow this project. Your contributions are more than welcomed!

## Install

```npm
npm i -g random-positive-messages
```

# Usage
